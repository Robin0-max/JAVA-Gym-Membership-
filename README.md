Gym Membership Management System (Java Desktop App): This Gym Membership Management System is a Java desktop application that utilizes four core classes to efficiently manage gym memberships. At its foundation, the abstract GymMember class defines the common properties and behaviors shared by all members, ensuring a consistent structure. Two subclasses, RegularMember and PremiumMember, inherit from GymMember and represent different membership tiers, each with their own specific features and benefitsâ€”such as premium discounts or access to exclusive facilities for PremiumMember. The GymGUI class leverages Java Swing to provide a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing gym staff to add, update, or remove members, process payments, and perform other management tasks. Together, these classes create a modular and extensible system for handling all aspects of gym member administration.
