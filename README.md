This Gym Membership Management System is a computer program that helps a gym keep track of its members. It uses four main parts:

- GymMember: This is like a basic template for any gym member. It has the usual details that every member needs, like name, ID, and birthday.
- RegularMember: This is for normal members who pay the standard fee and get basic access to the gym.
- PremiumMember: This is for special members who pay more to get extra benefits, such as access to special classes or discounts.
- GymGUI: This is the part of the program you see and click on. It lets the gym staff easily add, update, or remove members and manage their information.
In short, the program makes it simple for the gym to organize all its members and their details.
